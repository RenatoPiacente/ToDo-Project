# Created this app inside the project directory

## This app has been created along the about and users app at the beginning of the project

So far the Tasks app has been used to store some new urls that have been shown in the home page and at /helloworld page.

In order to create the url path to the homepage, for example, we've created two directories inside the app directory
'Templates'/'Tasks'and inside the 'Tasks' we'va added the list.html file, which, cointain the base code that's current showing at our homepage of the ToDo project.
