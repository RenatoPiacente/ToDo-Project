# Creating a ToDo Project with Django

Learning how to create a project using Django and commiting every new implementation to my Git Repository.

## URLs 

Created a few urls inside the Project, one to show the "Hello, World!" phrase and another to change the home screen of our webpage.

Theres a few steps I must learn in order to become second nature to work with Django, it's been slow and steady, but I'm aquiring the necessary knowledge bit per bit.
